This document describes how to use the API to send messages to WhatsApp users.
Message types
You can use the API to send the following types of messages.
Address messages allow you to easily request a delivery address from WhatsApp users.


Audio messages display an audio icon and a link to an audio file. When the WhatsApp user taps the icon, the WhatsApp client loads and plays the audio file.


Contacts messages allow you to send rich contact information directly to WhatsApp users, such as names, phone numbers, physical addresses, and email addresses.


Document messages display a document icon, linked to a document that a WhatsApp user can tap to download.


Image messages display a single image and an optional caption.


Interactive CTA URL button messages allow you to map any URL to a button, so you don’t have to include lengthy or obscure raw URLs in the message body.


Interactive Flow messages allow you to send structured messages that are more natural or comfortable for your customers. For example, you can use WhatsApp Flows to book appointments, browse products, collect customer feedback, get new sales leads, or anything else.
Interactive Flow messages are documented in our WhatsApp Flows documentation set.


Interactive list messages allow you to present WhatsApp users with a list of options to choose from.


Interactive location request messages display body text and a send location button. When a WhatsApp user taps the button, a location sharing screen appears which the user can use to share their location.


Interactive reply buttons messages allow you to send up to three predefined replies for users to choose from.


Location messages allow you to send a location’s latitude and longitude coordinates to a WhatsApp user.


Sticker messages display animated or static sticker images in a WhatsApp message.


Text messages are messages containing only a text body and an optional link preview.


Template messages allow you to send marketing, utility, and authentication templates to WhatsApp users. Unlike all other message types, template messages do not require a 24-hour customer service window to be open between you and the message recipient before the message can be sent.


Video messages display a thumbnail preview of a video image with an optional caption. When the WhatsApp user taps the preview, it loads the video and displays it to the user.


Reaction messages are emoji-reactions that you can apply to a previous WhatsApp user message that you have received.
