Analytics
Updated: Nov 19, 2025
Starting December 1, 2025, the maximum lookback window for messaging, conversation, and pricing analytics is changing from 10 years to 1 year. The lookback window for template and template group analytics will be unaffected and will continue to be 90 days.
This document describes how to get messaging, conversation, and template analytics, such as the number of messages sent from a business phone number, the number of conversations and their costs for a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA), or the number of times a given template has been read.
Only metrics for business phone numbers and templates associated with your WABA at the time of the request will be included in responses.

Examples
Given a time range, you can get conversation and cost information associated with your WABA. If you want, you can filter and break down your results. See the code samples below for examples.
Get monthly data, using all breakdowns
Scenario: Given a month, you want to retrieve all conversation and cost information for all phone numbers associated with a WABA.
Suggested Solution:Assemble the URL you want to call and include the following filtering parameters:
start: Start of your time range. In this case, the beginning of the month you want metrics for.
end: End of your time range. In this case, the end of the month you want metrics for.
granularity: How granular you want your data points to be. In the example below, we use MONTHLY, so each datapoint will represent a month’s worth of data.
phone_numbers: Send an empty array and we return information for all phone numbers associated with the WABA.
dimensions: Set it to all available breakdowns: "CONVERSATION_CATEGORY", "CONVERSATION_TYPE", "COUNTRY", and "PHONE".
In this case, you do not need to specify country_codes, metric_types, conversation_types and conversation_categories. If you don’t send us anything for those fields, we return all available options. Once you set up the URL, make a GET request:
curl -i -X GET
"https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/102290129340398
  ?fields=conversation_analytics
  .start(1685602800).end(1688194800)
  .granularity(MONTHLY)
  .phone_numbers([])
  .dimensions(["CONVERSATION_CATEGORY","CONVERSATION_TYPE","COUNTRY","PHONE"])
  &access_token=BLI8lkj..."
A successful response returns a conversation_analytics object with the data you have requested. In the following example, the WABA contains only one phone number.

Volume tier information
Include the TIER, PRICING_CATEGORY, and COUNTRY parameters in the dimensions array to get volume tier information. Data points representing messages affected by volume tier pricing will have a tier property in the response.
Example response syntax with tier information
{
  "start": <START_TIMESTAMP>,
  "end": <END_TIMESTAMP>,
  "phone_number": "<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER>",
  "country": "<COUNTRY_CODE>",
  "tier": "<LOWER>:<UPPER>",
  "pricing_type": "<PRICING_TYPE>",
  "pricing_category": "<PRICING_CATEGORY>",
  "volume": <VOLUME>,
  "cost": <COST>
}

The tier property value represents a concatenation of the lower and upper bounds for the tier specific to the market–category pair (country and pricing_category) that that data point represents.
<LOWER> – An integer representing the lower bound of the tier (inclusive).
<UPPER> – An integer representing the upper bound of the tier (inclusive), or the string MAX.
Notes
To determine your current volume tier, read the tier, country, and pricing_category values. The tier value’s <UPPER> integer (the integer after the colon) tells you your current tier for the country and pricing_category (for example, (India and utility, respectively).
To determine how many messages you need to send to reach the next tier for a given country and pricing_category, subtract the volume integer from the tier value’s <UPPER> integer.
Volume tiers will only be available for utility and authentication template messages. For marketing template messages (where volume tiers will not apply), tier will be set to 0:MAX.
The tier property will be omitted for data points that represent free messages, since free messages don’t contribute to tiering counts.
Volume tiers will be determined solely by Meta. All insights data is approximate due to small variations in data processing. Undue reliance should not be placed on insights data.

Template analytics
Template analytics describe the number of times a template has been sent, delivered, and read, and the number of times URL buttons or Quick Reply buttons in the template have been clicked. Additionally, onboarded MM API for WhatsApp businesses can track offsite conversion metrics.
Data is returned with a daily granularity in the default timezone of UTC and WABA’s timezone, with a lookback window of up to 90 days. To show data in the WABA’s configured timezone, pass in the use_waba_timezone param with a value of true.
Display data in the WABA’s configured timezone by passing in the use_waba_timezone param with a value of true.
{
 "data": [
   {
     "waba_timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
     "granularity": "DAILY",
     "product_type": "cloud_api",
     "data_points": [
         ...
     ]
   }
}

Limitations
Template Analytics are only available for On-Premises API if the account has not opted into Cloud API template analytics.
Button click analytics are only available for templates categorized as MARKETING or UTILITY.
WABAs owned by or shared with Meta Business Accounts in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Japan, or that have a business phone number with a country calling code from any of those countries or regions, are not supported.
Offsite conversion metrics are available exclusively for businesses onboarded to MM API for WhatsApp.
Read and click event data for WhatsApp template messages is only available for up to 7 days from the date the message is sent. After this 7-day window, the corresponding read/click counts reset to zero and no further updates are recorded for those messages.
Confirming template analytics
You must confirm template analytics on your WhatsApp Business Account before you can get template analytics. You can confirm template analytics using the WhatsApp Manager or the API.
By confirming access via the API, you direct Meta to add insights to your WhatsApp Business Account. These insights include link tracking to report website clicks. You can turn off link tracking on each message template. You also direct Meta to collect and anonymize data from your chats with customers. Meta will anonymize this data to improve services it provides you and other businesses.
To confirm via API, send the following request:
POST /<WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID>?is_enabled_for_insights=true

Once confirmed, we will begin capturing template analytics for the WhatsApp Business Account. Once confirmed, template analytics cannot be disabled.
Upon success, the API will respond with your WhatsApp Business Account ID. For example:
{
  "id": 102290129340398
}

Cost and click metrics
Cost metrics are returned as an array of cost objects, each with a type and value. Types can be:
amount_spent — Total amount spent on conversations opened within the start and end timeframe as a result of sending the template. See Opening Conversations.
cost_per_delivered — The amount_spent value divided by the number of times the template was delivered within the start and end timeframe.
cost_per_url_button_click — The amount_spent value divided by the number of times the template’s URL button was clicked, within the start and end timeframe. Quick reply button clicks are not included. Object omitted if the template does not have a URL button.
Click metrics are returned as an array of JSON objects each with a type and value. Clicks are only returned for URL buttons and quick-reply buttons in templates categorized as MARKETING or UTILITY.
Types can be:
url_button — The total number of clicks on the url button.
unique_url_button — Unique clicks track the number of distinct WhatsApp accounts that have clicked on a button. This metric helps you understand how many individual users are engaging with your CTAs, while eliminating duplicate clicks from the same recipient and providing an accurate measurement of engagement.
Disabling button click analytics
You can disable button click tracking on an individual template by setting its cta_url_link_tracking_opted_out field to true. Once disabled, the API will no longer return the clicked property in template analytics or display button engagement/clicks in the WhatsApp Manager when viewing the template’s insights.

Limitations
Button click analytics are only available for templates categorized as marketing or utility. WABAs owned by or shared with Meta Business Accounts in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Japan, or that have a business phone number with a country calling code from any of those countries or regions, are not supported.
Enabling template analytics
You must enable template analytics on your WhatsApp Business Account before you can get template group analytics. You can confirm template analytics enablement using the WhatsApp Manager or the API.
By confirming access via the API, you direct Meta to add insights to your WhatsApp Business Account. These insights include link tracking to report website clicks. You can turn off link tracking on each message template. You also direct Meta to collect and anonymize data from your chats with customers. Meta will anonymize this data to improve services it provides you and other businesses.
To confirm enablement via API, send the following request:
POST /<WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID>?is_enabled_for_insights=true
Upon success, the API will respond with your WhatsApp Business Account ID and we will begin capturing template group analytics for the WhatsApp Business Account.
Once enabled, template analytics cannot be disabled.

Cost and click metrics
Cost metrics are returned as an array of cost objects, each with a type and value. Types can be:
amount_spent — Total amount spent on conversations opened within the start and end timeframe as a result of sending the template. See Opening Conversations.
cost_per_delivered — The amount_spent value divided by the number of times the template was delivered within the start and end timeframe.
cost_per_url_button_click — The amount_spent value divided by the number of times the template’s URL button was clicked, within the start and end timeframe. Quick reply button clicks are not included. Object omitted if the template does not have a URL button.
Click metrics are returned as an array of JSON objects each with a type and value. Clicks are only returned for URL buttons and quick-reply buttons in templates categorized as marketing or utility.
Types can be:
url_button — The total number of clicks on the url button.
unique_url_button — Unique clicks track the number of distinct WhatsApp accounts that have clicked on a button. This metric helps you understand how many individual users are engaging with your CTAs, while eliminating duplicate clicks from the same recipient and providing an accurate measurement of engagement.
